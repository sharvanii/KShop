# KShop
Kshop is a full stack e-commerce website where users/customers will be able to shop various products related to a KPop Boy Band named BTS. I'm still working on the website. It is not fully developed yet. Once the website is develeoped users will be able to search the products and add them to the wishlist and cart. Furthermore, i will add a payment gateway by which user can pay for their orders.
## Currently existing bugs
Currently, my 'see products" link is not working in the products page. I will try to fix that soon. Then users will be able to see the available products.
